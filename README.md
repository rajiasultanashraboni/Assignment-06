# Project Title : Peddy - Pet Adoption Platform

## Short description of the project
Peddy - Pet Adoption Platform is a web-based application designed to simplify and enhance the process of pet adoption. It serves as a bridge between animal shelters, rescues, and individuals looking to adopt pets, providing an intuitive interface where users can browse through various categories of animals available for adoption.

## ES6 features used

In the Peddy - Pet Adoption Platform, various ES6 features are likely used to enhance code readability, maintainability, and performance. Here are some key ES6 features that could be utilized in this project:

- **Arrow Functions:** Arrow functions provide a concise syntax for writing functions, especially useful for callbacks and promise handling.

* **Example:**
const fetchCategories = async () => {
  // Fetching data logic
};
- **Template Literals:** Template literals make it easier to embed expressions within strings, allowing cleaner code when dealing with dynamic content, such as rendering pet details.

* **Example:**
const petName = 'Max';
console.log(`Adopt your new friend, ${petName}!`);

- **Destructuring:** Destructuring allows for extracting values from arrays or properties from objects in a concise manner, ideal for handling API responses.

* **Example:**
const { category, pets } = responseData;

- **Default Parameters:** Functions can have default parameter values, which are useful for providing fallback values when no arguments are passed.

* **Example:**
function fetchPets(type = 'all') {
  // Fetch logic for pets
}
- **Modules (Import/Export):** ES6 modules enable cleaner separation of code by allowing importing and exporting functionality across different files.

* **Example:**
import { fetchCategories } from './api.js';
These ES6 features contribute to writing cleaner and more efficient JavaScript in modern web development.
